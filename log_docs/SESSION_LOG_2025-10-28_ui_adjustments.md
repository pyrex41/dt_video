# Session Log - UI Adjustments & Window Sizing
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Session Focus:** Final UI tweaks and window configuration

---

## Overview
Quick session to finalize UI layout and window sizing based on user feedback.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Header Button Repositioning

**File:** `clipforge/src/components/header.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Moved Reset button from **left side** to **right side** of header
- Positioned as the **leftmost button** on the right side
- Changed header icon from custom Logo SVG to Film icon from lucide-react

**Button Order (Right Side):**
1. Reset üîÑ
2. Import üì•
3. Record üìπ
4. Save üíæ
5. Export üì§

**Rationale:**
- Keeps destructive action (Reset) with other actions
- Maintains left side for branding only
- More logical grouping of functional buttons

**Code Change:**
```tsx
// Before
<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
  <Logo className="h-8 w-8 text-blue-400" />
  <div>...</div>
  <ResetButton />
</div>
<div className="flex items-center gap-3">
  <ImportButton />
  ...
</div>

// After
<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
  <Film className="h-8 w-8 text-blue-400" />
  <div>...</div>
</div>
<div className="flex items-center gap-3">
  <ResetButton />
  <ImportButton />
  ...
</div>
```

### 2. Window Size Configuration

**File:** `clipforge/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

**Changes:**
```json
{
  "width": 1680,
  "height": 1200,
  "minWidth": 1200,
  "minHeight": 800
}
```

**Previous:** 800x600 (reverted from earlier changes)
**Current:** 1680x1200 with minimum constraints

**Notes:**
- Provides professional video editor workspace
- 1680x1200 is optimal for timeline and preview visibility
- Minimum size prevents UI from becoming unusable
- Requires app restart to take effect

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- User to restart app to see new window size
- Verify Reset button positioning in UI
- Test all header buttons still function correctly

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for Reset action
- May want to add confirmation dialog for Reset
- Window size could be persisted in user preferences
