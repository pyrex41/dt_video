# ClipForge Project Log - October 28, 2025

## Session Summary
Completed video recording functionality with audio support and fixed all playback issues in the ClipForge video editor.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Video Recording with Audio
- ✅ Enabled audio capture for webcam recording (video + audio)
- ✅ Enabled audio capture for screen recording (video + audio)
- ✅ Used JavaScript MediaRecorder API with WebM format
- ✅ Changed from Rust nokhwa (had macOS issues) to browser getUserMedia/getDisplayMedia

### 2. Recording UX Improvements
- ✅ Added manual stop button (replaces "Record" button while recording)
- ✅ Shows recording type in button ("Stop Webcam Recording" vs "Stop Screen Recording")
- ✅ Store recorder and stream references for proper cleanup
- ✅ Added comprehensive `[ClipForge]` logging for debugging

### 3. Video Playback Fixes
- ✅ Fixed duplicate video display issue (added wrapper div)
- ✅ Configured Tauri asset protocol to allow loading local video files
- ✅ Fixed playback stuttering caused by feedback loop between timeline and player
- ✅ Added `isUpdatingFromPlayer` ref to prevent sync issues
- ✅ Increased sync threshold from 0.1s to 0.5s for smoother playback

### 4. FFmpeg Encoding Optimizations
- ✅ Fixed "width not divisible by 2" error with scale filter
- ✅ Added `-vf scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2` to ensure even dimensions
- ✅ Added `-preset fast` for faster encoding
- ✅ Added `-crf 23` for good quality/size balance
- ✅ Added `-movflags +faststart` for better streaming/playback
- ✅ Added `-b:a 128k` for consistent audio bitrate

### 5. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Updated tauri.conf.json with asset protocol scope: `["$APPDATA/clips/**"]`
- ✅ Updated CSP to include `asset:` and `tauri:` protocols
- ✅ Maintained macOS entitlements for camera and microphone access

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

#### `clipforge/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (lines 200-216)
- Added FFmpeg encoding optimizations
- Added video filter to ensure H.264 compatible dimensions

#### `clipforge/src/components/record-button.tsx`
- Added state for recording type and active recorder
- Added `stopRecording()` function for manual stop
- Added comprehensive logging to both webcam and screen handlers
- Changed button to show stop button while recording
- Added proper error handling in onstop callbacks

#### `clipforge/src/components/preview.tsx`
- Added `isUpdatingFromPlayer` ref to prevent feedback loop
- Modified timeupdate handler with 50ms debounce
- Increased sync threshold from 0.1s to 0.5s
- Added conditional check in playhead effect

#### `clipforge/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- Added asset protocol configuration
- Updated CSP

#### `.claude/commands/start-server.md`
- Moved from clipforge/.claude/ to parent .claude/ directory
- Custom slash command for restarting dev server

## Known Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: No video playback
**Problem:** Videos wouldn't load, showing "asset protocol not configured" error
**Solution:** Added asset protocol configuration in tauri.conf.json with proper scope

### Issue 2: Choppy/freezing video playback
**Problem:** Video player was stuttering and jumping during playback
**Solution:** Fixed feedback loop between video timeupdate and playhead sync, optimized FFmpeg encoding

### Issue 3: Screen recording failing with FFmpeg error
**Problem:** "width not divisible by 2" error for screen recordings with odd dimensions
**Solution:** Added `-vf scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2` filter to ensure even dimensions

### Issue 4: No way to stop recording early
**Problem:** Had to wait full 10 seconds for recording to complete
**Solution:** Added manual stop button that appears while recording

### Issue 5: No audio in recordings
**Problem:** Recordings had no audio track
**Solution:** Changed `audio: false` to `audio: true` in getUserMedia and getDisplayMedia

## Current State

### Working Features
- ✅ Webcam recording (10 seconds, with audio)
- ✅ Screen recording (10 seconds, with audio)
- ✅ Manual stop button for both recording types
- ✅ Video playback with Plyr controls
- ✅ Timeline visualization with Fabric.js
- ✅ Clip selection moves playhead
- ✅ FFmpeg conversion (WebM → MP4)

### Not Yet Tested
- ⏳ Import video files
- ⏳ Export final video
- ⏳ Trim/edit clips
- ⏳ Timeline scrubbing
- ⏳ Multiple clips playback

## Next Steps

1. Test import functionality
2. Test export functionality
3. Implement trim controls for clips
4. Add timeline scrubbing/drag functionality
5. Test multi-clip timeline playback
6. Add transitions between clips
7. Add text/overlay support

## Architecture Notes

### Recording Flow
1. User clicks Record → Webcam/Screen
2. Browser requests camera/screen permission
3. MediaRecorder starts recording WebM with VP8 video + Opus audio
4. After 10s or manual stop, recording ends
5. WebM data sent to Rust `save_recording` command
6. FFmpeg converts WebM → MP4 (H.264 + AAC)
7. MP4 file saved to `$APPDATA/clips/`
8. Clip added to timeline at end position

### Playback Flow
1. User clicks clip in timeline
2. Timeline sets playhead to clip.start
3. Preview component finds currentClip via playhead position
4. Video src set to `convertFileSrc(clip.path)` → `tauri://localhost/...`
5. Plyr initializes on video element
6. Plyr timeupdate → updates playhead (with debounce)
7. Playhead changes → syncs video (if > 0.5s difference)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
/start-server
# or
pnpm run tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm run tauri build

# Check FFmpeg
ffmpeg -version
```

## Commit Information

**Commit:** bd9eec6
**Branch:** master
**Message:** feat: complete video recording with audio and playback improvements

## Session Duration
Approximately 2-3 hours

## Notes
- macOS camera permissions working via entitlements
- WebM → MP4 conversion ensures broad compatibility
- Plyr provides good HTML5 video player UI
- Asset protocol required for Tauri to serve local video files
- H.264 encoder requires even dimensions (handled by scale filter)
