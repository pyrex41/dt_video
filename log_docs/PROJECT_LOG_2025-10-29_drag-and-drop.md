# ClipForge Development Log - Drag-and-Drop from Library to Timeline

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Session:** Drag-and-Drop Implementation
**Task:** Task 6 - Enable Drag-and-Drop from Library to Timeline (Complexity: 6)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Session Summary

Implemented intuitive drag-and-drop functionality enabling users to drag clips from the Media Library directly onto the Timeline. This completes a critical UX workflow, making video assembly feel natural and efficient. Users can now build their video timeline by simply dragging clips, with intelligent positioning that prevents overlaps.

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Draggable Clips in Media Library

**File:** `clipforge/src/components/media-library.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `draggable` attribute to clip cards
- Implemented `onDragStart` handler to serialize clip data
- Added visual feedback during drag (opacity: 0.5)
- Implemented `onDragEnd` handler to restore opacity
- Changed cursor from `cursor-pointer` to `cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing`
- Set `draggable={false}` on thumbnail images to prevent image drag conflict

**Key Code:**
```typescript
<div
  key={clip.id}
  draggable
  onDragStart={(e) => {
    e.dataTransfer.setData("application/json", JSON.stringify(clip))
    e.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = "copy"
    if (e.currentTarget instanceof HTMLElement) {
      e.currentTarget.style.opacity = "0.5"
    }
  }}
  onDragEnd={(e) => {
    if (e.currentTarget instanceof HTMLElement) {
      e.currentTarget.style.opacity = "1"
    }
  }}
  className="... cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing"
>
```

**UX Details:**
- Serializes full clip data as JSON in drag event
- Uses `copy` effect to indicate creating timeline instance
- 50% opacity during drag provides clear visual feedback
- Grab cursor indicates draggability

### 2. Drop Handling on Timeline

**File:** `clipforge/src/components/timeline.tsx`

**New Functions Added:**

#### `handleDragOver()`
```typescript
const handleDragOver = (e: React.DragEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  e.dataTransfer.dropEffect = "copy"
}
```
- Prevents default behavior to allow drop
- Sets drop effect to "copy" for visual consistency

#### `handleDrop()`
```typescript
const handleDrop = (e: React.DragEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()

  try {
    const clipData = JSON.parse(e.dataTransfer.getData("application/json"))
    const canvas = fabricCanvasRef.current
    if (!canvas) return

    // Calculate drop position in timeline
    const rect = canvasRef.current?.getBoundingClientRect()
    if (!rect) return

    const dropX = e.clientX - rect.left
    const dropTime = Math.max(0, dropX / zoom)

    // Find the end of existing clips
    const lastClipEnd = clips.length > 0
      ? Math.max(...clips.map(c => c.end))
      : 0

    // Use drop position if after existing clips, otherwise append
    const startTime = Math.max(dropTime, lastClipEnd)

    // Generate new unique ID for timeline instance
    const newClip = {
      ...clipData,
      id: `${clipData.id}-${Date.now()}`,
      start: startTime,
      end: startTime + clipData.duration,
      trimStart: clipData.trimStart || 0,
      trimEnd: clipData.trimEnd || clipData.duration,
      track: 0,
    }

    // Add to timeline and update UI
    useClipStore.getState().addClip(newClip)
    setPlayhead(startTime)
    setSelectedClip(newClip.id)

    console.log('[ClipForge] Clip dropped:', { dropTime, startTime, clip: newClip })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('[ClipForge] Failed to drop clip:', err)
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Position Calculation**: Converts mouse X coordinate to timeline position accounting for zoom
2. **Smart Placement**: Places at drop position OR appends after existing clips (whichever is later)
3. **Collision Prevention**: Never overlaps existing clips
4. **Unique IDs**: Creates new timeline-specific ID (`originalId-timestamp`)
5. **Auto-Selection**: Automatically selects and positions playhead at new clip
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with console logging

---

### 3. Timeline Component Integration

**Changes:**
```typescript
return (
  <div
    className="relative border-t border-zinc-800 bg-zinc-900"
    onDragOver={handleDragOver}
    onDrop={handleDrop}
  >
    <canvas ref={canvasRef} />
  </div>
)
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Drop handlers attached to container div (not canvas element)
- Canvas remains for Fabric.js rendering
- Event bubbling properly handled

---

## Smart Clip Placement Logic

### Algorithm Flow

1. **Calculate Drop Position**
   ```
   dropX = mouseX - canvasBoundingRect.left
   dropTime = dropX / zoom
   ```

2. **Find Timeline End**
   ```
   lastClipEnd = max(clip.end for all clips)
   ```

3. **Determine Start Position**
   ```
   startTime = max(dropTime, lastClipEnd)
   ```

4. **Position New Clip**
   ```
   newClip.start = startTime
   newClip.end = startTime + duration
   ```

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Empty Timeline**
- Drop at 5s → Clip placed at 5s ✅

**Scenario 2: Existing Clip Ends at 10s**
- Drop at 3s → Clip placed at 10s (prevents overlap) ✅
- Drop at 15s → Clip placed at 15s (after existing clips) ✅

**Scenario 3: Multiple Clips**
- Last clip ends at 25s
- Drop at any position < 25s → Clip appends at 25s ✅

- **`clipforge/src/components/media-library.tsx`**
  - Added draggable attributes to clip cards (~10 lines)
  - Implemented drag event handlers
  - Updated cursor styling

- **`clipforge/src/components/timeline.tsx`**

## User Experience Flow

### Before This Implementation
1. User imports videos into Media Library
2. User must manually... (no direct way to add to timeline!)
3. Workflow incomplete ❌

### After This Implementation
1. User imports videos into Media Library ✅
2. User sees draggable clip cards with grab cursor ✅
3. User drags clip onto timeline ✅
4. Clip appears at intelligent position ✅
5. Playhead jumps to new clip ✅
6. Clip auto-selected for editing ✅
7. Multiple clips can be dragged sequentially ✅

---

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Clips in Media Library show grab cursor
- [x] Dragging clip changes opacity to 50%
- [x] Drop on timeline creates new clip instance
- [x] Drop positioning respects existing clips
- [x] Playhead moves to dropped clip
- [x] Dropped clip is auto-selected
- [x] Multiple drops work sequentially
- [x] Original library clip remains intact
- [x] Timeline renders new clip correctly

### Edge Cases Handled
- **Empty Timeline**: Clips place at exact drop position
- **Overlapping Drops**: Clips append after existing content
- **Rapid Multiple Drops**: Each gets unique ID with timestamp
- **Drop Outside Canvas**: Handled gracefully by boundary calc
- **Invalid Clip Data**: Caught by try-catch with error logging

---

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Copy Semantics**: Dragging from library creates new timeline instance (doesn't move)
2. **Unique IDs**: Timeline clips get composite IDs (`${originalId}-${timestamp}`)
3. **Non-Destructive**: Library clips unchanged, timeline has independent instances
4. **Auto-Selection**: UX improvement - new clips automatically selected for immediate editing
5. **Collision Prevention**: Smart positioning ensures no clip overlaps

### Performance Considerations
- JSON serialization minimal overhead (clip objects are small)
- Position calculation happens only on drop (not during drag)
- No re-renders during drag operation
- Canvas updates handled by existing Fabric.js render cycle

### Browser Compatibility
- Uses standard HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API
- `dataTransfer` with JSON payload supported in all modern browsers
- `getBoundingClientRect()` widely supported
- No external dependencies required

---

## Integration with Existing Features

### Works With:
- ✅ **Media Library Sidebar**: Drag source with thumbnails
- ✅ **Timeline Zoom**: Drop position correctly scaled by zoom level
- ✅ **Clip Selection**: Dropped clips auto-selected
- ✅ **Playhead Control**: Jumps to new clip position
- ✅ **Workspace Persistence**: Dropped clips saved in workspace
- ✅ **Auto-Fit Zoom**: Timeline rezizes after clip added

### Future Enhancements:
- Multi-select drag (drag multiple clips at once)
- Drag from timeline to reorder
- Snap-to-grid during drop
- Drop indicator line showing placement
- Drag preview thumbnail

---

## Code Quality

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Proper error handling with try-catch
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Type safety with TypeScript
- ✅ Consistent code style
- ✅ Clear variable naming
- ✅ Comments explaining complex logic

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- Backward compatible with workspace persistence
- No changes to Rust backend required
- No changes to data models

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
1. **Single-Track Only**: Clips always placed on track 0 (main track)
2. **Sequential Placement**: Cannot drag between existing clips yet
3. **No Visual Preview**: No ghost/preview of where clip will land
4. **No Undo**: Dropped clips must be manually deleted if unwanted

### Planned Improvements
1. **Multi-Track Support**: Detect drop Y-position for track selection
2. **Insert Mode**: Allow dropping between clips with automatic shifting
3. **Drop Preview**: Visual indicator line showing exact placement
4. **Undo/Redo**: Add to undo stack for easy reversal

## Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ **DRAG-AND-DROP COMPLETE**

The core editing workflow is now functional - users can import videos, see them in the media library with thumbnails, and drag them onto the timeline to build their video. The smart placement logic ensures clips never overlap, and the visual feedback makes the interaction feel polished and professional.

This implementation enables the fundamental use case: **assembling multiple video clips into a sequence**. Combined with the existing trim functionality, users can now perform basic video editing tasks end-to-end.

**Key Achievement:** The media library is no longer just a passive display - it's now an active part of the editing workflow. Drag-and-drop makes video assembly intuitive and fast.
