**Last Updated:** January 29, 2025 (Evening Session)
**Project Status:** Active Development - Core Features Complete + Playhead Logic Fixed

---

## Recent Accomplishments (Last 5 Sessions)

### Session 5: Playhead & Clip Offset Coordinate Logic Fix âœ…
**Date:** January 29, 2025 (Evening)

**Major Achievements:**
- Fixed critical playhead coordinate calculation bugs
- Removed problematic auto-selection behavior
- Fixed timeupdate handler closure capturing stale clip data
- Implemented proper timeline auto-scroll on clip selection

**Root Cause Resolved:**
Timeline playhead position (timeline coordinates) was being confused with video file playback position (file coordinates + clip offset). When switching clips, the video would seek to the wrong frame because the timeupdate handler used stale clip data from a closure instead of current store state.

**Key Technical Fixes:**
1. **Removed auto-selection** - Playhead now independent of clip selection
2. **Fixed closure bug** - Timeupdate handler now fetches current clip from store using `useClipStore.getState()` instead of closure variable
3. **Reset scrollOffset on zoom** - `autoFitZoom()` now resets scrollOffset to maintain coordinate consistency
4. **Auto-scroll on selection** - Timeline centers on playhead when clip selection changes

**New Behavior:**
- Clicking a clip selects it but doesn't move playhead
- Video shows frame at `trimStart + (playhead - clip.start)`
- Handles playhead outside clip bounds (shows first/last frame)

**Files Modified:**
- `clipforge/src/components/preview.tsx` - Removed auto-selection, fixed timeupdate closure
- `clipforge/src/components/timeline.tsx` - Added auto-scroll on selection change
- `clipforge/src/store/use-clip-store.ts` - Reset scrollOffset when zoom changes

**Impact:** Playhead behavior now correct and predictable across all clip switching scenarios

---

### Session 4: Playhead Sync Refactor âœ…
**Date:** January 29, 2025 (Afternoon)

**Major Achievements:**
- Complete rewrite of video preview playhead synchronization
- Separated clip selection from seek logic to prevent loops
- Fixed container sizing to prevent jumping between clips
- Created `/load-progress` command for quick context recovery

**Key Technical Improvements:**
- Removed `isLoadingNewSource` flag and complex state management
- Consolidated from 3 competing seek effects to clear separation of concerns
- Moved auto-selection from useMemo to dedicated useEffect
- Fixed-size container (960px, 16:9) with `object-contain`

**Files Modified:**
- `clipforge/src/components/preview.tsx` - Major refactor (286 lines changed)
- `.claude/commands/load-progress.md` - New command
- `log_docs/current_progress.md` - Updated

**Status:** Partially resolved clip switching issues, led to Session 5 fixes

---

- Visibility checks for off-screen elements
- Aggressive DOM cleanup for orphaned Plyr elements

**Files Modified:**
- `clipforge/src/components/timeline.tsx` - 387 line changes
- `clipforge/src/components/preview.tsx` - 303 line changes

### Session 1: Play/Pause Sync & HMR Fixes âœ…
**Date:** October 29, 2025

**Major Achievements:**
- Fixed play/pause button desynchronization
- Eliminated duplicate video players after HMR refresh
- Implemented proper Promise handling for `player.play()`
- Added guard flags to prevent circular state update loops

**Technical Solutions:**
- `isUpdatingPlayState` ref guard with 100ms debounce

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Timeline Responsiveness** - Uses 100ms polling (could optimize to 250ms)
2. **Play/Pause Debounce** - 100ms guard prevents >10 actions/second
3. **Timeupdate Frequency** - Handler fires 30-60 times/second during playback

### No Critical Blockers
All core functionality working as expected. Issues are optimization opportunities, not blocking problems.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Zustand** - State management (workspace, clips, playhead)
- **Fabric.js** - Canvas-based timeline rendering
- **Plyr** - Video player with professional controls
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling

### Backend
- **Tauri v2.9.2** - Desktop app framework

---

## Architecture Patterns

### State Management
- **Zustand Store** - Central state for clips, playhead, scrollOffset, zoom
- **React State** - Component-local state (Plyr instance, loading states)
- **Refs** - Guard flags to prevent race conditions

### Playhead Behavior (New)
- **Independent Playhead** - Moves freely, doesn't trigger clip selection
- **Manual Selection** - User clicks clips to select
- **Offset-Based Seeking** - `video_time = trimStart + (playhead - clip.start)`
- **Boundary Handling** - Shows first/last frame when playhead outside clip

### Video Playback Strategy
- **Single Plyr Instance** - Initialize once, swap sources via `player.source` API
- **Store-Based Clip Lookup** - Timeupdate handler fetches current clip from store (not closure)
- **Auto-Scroll on Selection** - Timeline centers on playhead when clip changes

### Timeline Rendering
- **Fabric.js Canvas** - Custom rendering for clips, playhead, ruler
- **ClipPath Constraint** - Prevents content rendering over track labels
- **Visibility Culling** - Skip off-screen element rendering
- **Responsive Width** - CSS + polling + sync on render
- **ScrollOffset Reset** - Resets to 0 when zoom changes to maintain coordinate consistency

### Coordinate System
- **Timeline Position**: Absolute time in seconds from timeline start
- **Video Position**: `trimStart + (timeline_pos - clip.start)`
- **Rendering**: `screen_x = time * zoom - scrollOffset + TRACK_LABEL_WIDTH`
- **Click Inverse**: `time = (screen_x - TRACK_LABEL_WIDTH + scrollOffset) / zoom`

## Lessons Learned

### Session 5 Insights

**1. Closure Pitfalls in Event Handlers**
Event handlers set up once with empty dependencies capture variables in closures, leading to stale data.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BAD: Captures currentClip at handler setup time
player.on("timeupdate", () => {
  const pos = currentClip.start + time  // Stale!
})

// GOOD: Fetches current state each time
player.on("timeupdate", () => {
  const clip = useClipStore.getState().clips.find(...)
  const pos = clip.start + time  // Fresh!
})
```

**2. Coordinate System Consistency**
When variables represent pixel measurements (like `scrollOffset`) and zoom changes, those measurements must be recalculated or reset.

**Formula Relationship:**
- Rendering: `screen_x = time * zoom - scrollOffset + TRACK_LABEL_WIDTH`
- Inverse: `time = (screen_x - TRACK_LABEL_WIDTH + scrollOffset) / zoom`

Both must use the same zoom and scrollOffset values.

**3. Separation of Timeline vs Video Coordinates**
- Timeline playhead = absolute position in timeline coordinates
- Video playback = position within video file (accounts for clip offset + trim)
- Key calculation: `video_time = trimStart + (playhead - clip.start)`

---

## Performance Notes

- Timeupdate events fire ~30-60 times per second during playback
- `isUpdatingFromPlayer` guard prevents circular updates
- 50ms debounce prevents rapid playhead jitter
- Scroll offset changes trigger timeline re-render (acceptable performance)
- Store.getState() calls in timeupdate have negligible performance impact
