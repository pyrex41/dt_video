# ClipForge Development Log - October 29, 2025
## Timeline Responsive Width & Scroll Clipping Fixes

### Session Summary
Extensive session focused on fixing two critical timeline issues:
1. Timeline not expanding to full width when window resizes
2. Clips scrolling over track labels when horizontally scrolling

### Changes Made

#### Timeline Component (`clipforge/src/components/timeline.tsx`)

**Responsive Width Implementation:**
- Added CSS `width: 100%` to canvas element (line 718)
- Implemented width sync in render useEffect to match Fabric.js internal dimensions with CSS width (lines 112-119)
- Added polling mechanism (100ms interval) to detect width changes (lines 62-75)
- Added window resize event listener as fallback (lines 53-60)
- Removed complex ResizeObserver approach in favor of simpler polling + sync on render

**Scroll Clipping:**
- Added Fabric.js clipPath to prevent content rendering over track labels (lines 117-124)
- ClipPath constrains all content (clips, playhead, ruler marks) to start at `TRACK_LABEL_WIDTH` (60px)
- Added visibility checks for ruler marks to skip off-screen rendering (lines 175-178)
- Added visibility checks for clips to skip completely off-screen clips (lines 210-213)
- Added visibility check for playhead to only render when visible (line 508)

**Code References:**
- Canvas styling: `clipforge/src/components/timeline.tsx:717-721`
- Width sync logic: `clipforge/src/components/timeline.tsx:112-119`
- ClipPath creation: `clipforge/src/components/timeline.tsx:117-124`
- Polling interval: `clipforge/src/components/timeline.tsx:62-75`

#### Preview Component (`clipforge/src/components/preview.tsx`)

**Video Playback Fix:**
- Added missing `video.src = convertFileSrc(currentClip.path)` to set video source (line 47)
- Implemented destroy/recreate Plyr pattern on clip changes (lines 27-118)
- Added aggressive DOM cleanup to remove orphaned Plyr elements (line 44)
- Fixed play/pause state synchronization with guard flags (lines 74-88, 148-165)

**Code References:**
- Video source fix: `clipforge/src/components/preview.tsx:47`
- Plyr recreation: `clipforge/src/components/preview.tsx:33-55`
- DOM cleanup: `clipforge/src/components/preview.tsx:44`

#### Store Updates (`clipforge/src/store/use-clip-store.ts`)

**Scroll Support:**
- `scrollOffset` already existed in store with `Math.max(0, offset)` constraint (line 88)
- This prevents negative scrolling (clips going off-screen to the left)

#### Dependencies

**Added:**
- `konva@10.0.8` - Evaluated as alternative to Fabric.js (not yet implemented)
- `react-konva@19.2.0` - React bindings for Konva (not yet implemented)

#### Configuration Fixes

**Tauri Configuration:**
- Removed `api-all` feature from `Cargo.toml` (not available in Tauri v2)
- Changed to `features = []` for Tauri 2.9.2 compatibility
- Deleted `Cargo.lock` to regenerate with correct feature set
- Restored `tauri.conf.react.json` as primary config

**Files Modified:**
- `clipforge/src-tauri/Cargo.toml:18` - Removed api-all feature
- `clipforge/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Restored React config

### Issues Encountered

1. **HMR Not Updating Properly**
   - Multiple dev server restarts required
   - Changes not always reflected immediately

2. **Cargo Feature Lock**
   - Linter/formatter kept reverting `api-all` back into Cargo.toml
   - Resolved by using `sed` command and deleting Cargo.lock

3. **Window Resize Events Not Firing**
   - Tried multiple approaches: ResizeObserver on parent, window events, root container observation
   - Final solution: Combination of CSS width:100%, polling, and sync on every render

### Technical Approach Evolution

**Timeline Width - Attempted Solutions:**
1. ❌ Tailwind `w-full` class alone (Fabric.js overrides)
2. ❌ ResizeObserver on parent element (unreliable)
3. ❌ ResizeObserver on root container (didn't exist)
4. ❌ Window resize events alone (not firing consistently)
5. ✅ **Final**: CSS `width: 100%` + polling (100ms) + sync on every render

**Plyr Duplication - Attempted Solutions:**
1. ❌ React keys with clip ID + track
2. ❌ React keys with clip.start
3. ❌ Manual DOM cleanup with querySelector
4. ❌ Single Plyr instance reuse
5. ✅ **Final**: Destroy/recreate Plyr on every clip change + aggressive DOM cleanup

### Current Status

**Working:**
- ✅ Clips are clipped at track label boundary (cannot render over "Track 1", "Track 2", etc.)
- ✅ Video playback working with proper source
- ✅ Play/pause state synchronization
- ✅ Horizontal scrolling with trackpad/mouse wheel
- ✅ Middle-click pan

**Pending Verification:**
- ⏳ Timeline expanding to full width on window resize (implementation complete, needs user testing)
- ⏳ No duplicate video previews (destroy/recreate pattern implemented, needs testing)

### Next Steps

1. **Test Timeline Responsiveness**
   - Resize window and verify timeline expands
   - Check console logs for "Syncing width before render" messages
   - Verify polling is detecting width changes

2. **Test Plyr Single Instance**
   - Move clips between tracks
   - Verify only one video preview appears
   - Check console for Plyr creation/destruction logs

3. **Consider Konva Migration** (if current approach continues to have issues)
   - Konva has better built-in responsive support
   - `react-konva` provides React components
   - Would eliminate need for manual width syncing

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Current polling at 100ms may be aggressive
   - Consider increasing to 250ms if no issues

### Code Quality Notes

- Added comprehensive logging for debugging resize and Plyr issues
- Used guard flags to prevent race conditions in play/pause state
- Proper cleanup in useEffect return functions
- Visibility checks improve performance by not rendering off-screen elements
