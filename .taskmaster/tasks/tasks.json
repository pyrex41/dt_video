On MouseUp, if no overlap is detected and the target track differs, the handler updates clip.track (types/clip.ts:8) and shows a status message; otherwise, it cancels the drop and informs the user. Tracks highlight brighter when hovered during drag to indicate the active drop lane. Existing multi-track rendering continues to map lanes with Y-offsets by index.
