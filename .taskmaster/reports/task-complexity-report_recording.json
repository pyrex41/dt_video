		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance File Import for Multiple Files",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as the task is already broken down into clear subtasks covering dialog modification, frontend handling, and error management.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves modifying existing Tauri and frontend code for multi-file selection, with moderate technical challenges in handling arrays and loops, but dependencies are minimal and testing is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Add Batch Import Progress Indicator",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as the task is already divided into UI component creation and integration with import logic.",
			"reasoning": "Building a progress bar UI and integrating with state updates is moderately complex due to real-time updates and error handling, but leverages existing import functionality with low dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Media Library Sidebar Component",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as the task is already subdivided into component structure, data fetching, and collapsible functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a new React component with data integration and UI interactions involves moderate effort in layout, state management, and responsiveness, with some testing for UI integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Thumbnail Generation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as the task is already broken into FFmpeg command creation, storage management, integration, and data model updates.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to FFmpeg integration in Rust, file I/O, path management, and cross-format testing, requiring careful error handling and backend-frontend coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Display Metadata in Media Library",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as the task is already split into metadata fetching/storage and UI rendering.",
			"reasoning": "Involves FFmpeg probing for metadata extraction, data storage updates, and UI formatting, with technical challenges in accurate data retrieval and display across formats."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Enable Drag-and-Drop from Library to Timeline",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as the task is already divided into implementing drag functionality and handling drop events.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing drag-and-drop with React DnD or HTML5 API requires moderate effort in event handling, data transfer, and integration with timeline store, with testing for positioning accuracy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Add Delete and Search/Filter to Media Library",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as the task is already subdivided into delete functionality and search/filter logic.",
			"reasoning": "Adding UI controls for deletion and filtering involves state management and user interactions, with moderate complexity in confirmation dialogs and real-time filtering."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PiP Recording Mode",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as the task is already extensively broken into UI extension, FFmpeg compositing, controls, audio mixing, and testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity from real-time FFmpeg compositing, UI controls for position/size, audio mixing, and synchronization, requiring extensive testing across devices and scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add Advanced Audio Controls",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed as the task is already divided into level monitoring, mute toggles, and command extensions.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating Web Audio API for real-time monitoring and controls, with backend command updates, involves technical challenges in audio processing and state management."
