# Project Log: Concat Button Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Session:** Concat Button Feature Implementation  
**Status:** âœ… Completed  

## Session Summary

Implemented and subsequently removed the concat button functionality for ClipForge. The concat button was designed to take all clips stacked as tracks, trim them to handle overlaps, and stitch them into a single continuous track. However, the user decided to pursue a different approach instead.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (`src/components/controls.tsx`)
- Added Merge icon import from lucide-react
- Added `isConcatenating` state for UI feedback
- Implemented `handleConcat` function that calls store method and handles progress
- Added purple concat button with progress bar that appears when 2+ clips exist
- Button shows "Concatenating..." during processing with real-time progress

### Store Changes (`src/store/use-clip-store.ts`)
- Added `concatClips: () => Promise<string>` to interface
- Implemented `concatClips` function that:
  - Collects all clips from all tracks
  - Sorts clips by timeline start position
  - Moves all clips to track 0 (same track line)
  - Calculates overlap trimming and repositions clips sequentially
  - Updates store state with repositioned clips
  - Calls backend `concat_clips` command with processed clip data
  - Returns the output file path

### Backend Changes (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`)
- Added `concat_clips` Tauri command to handler registration
- Implemented `concat_clips` function that:
  - Validates input clips exist
  - Pre-processes each clip with trimming using FFmpeg
  - Creates concat list file for FFmpeg concat demuxer
  - Executes concatenation with progress reporting
  - Cleans up temporary files
  - Returns output file path

### Build Artifacts
- Updated `dist/` assets with new compiled frontend code
- Tauri config updated (though may need v2.x compatibility fixes)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Overlap Trimming Logic
```typescript
// Collect all clips from all tracks, sort by start time
const sortedClips = [...state.clips].sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start)

// Calculate new sequential positions for all clips on track 0
let currentPosition = 0
const updatedClips = sortedClips.map((clip, index) => {
  const clipDuration = clip.trimEnd - clip.trimStart

  // Handle overlaps by trimming current clip if needed
  let actualTrimEnd = clip.trimEnd
  if (index < sortedClips.length - 1) {
    const nextClip = sortedClips[index + 1]
    const nextClipEnd = currentPosition + clipDuration

    if (nextClipEnd > nextClip.start) {
      // They would overlap, trim current clip to end at next clip's start
      const overlapDuration = nextClipEnd - nextClip.start
      if (overlapDuration < clipDuration) {
        actualTrimEnd = clip.trimEnd - overlapDuration
      }
    }
  }

  // Move all clips to track 0 and reposition sequentially
  const updatedClip = {
    ...clip,
    track: 0, // Move all clips to track 0
    start: currentPosition,
    end: currentPosition + (actualTrimEnd - clip.trimStart),
    trimEnd: actualTrimEnd
  }

  currentPosition += (actualTrimEnd - clip.trimStart)
  return updatedClip
})
```

### FFmpeg Processing Pipeline
1. **Individual Clip Processing**: Each clip is trimmed to handle overlaps
2. **Concat List Creation**: Temporary text file with file paths for FFmpeg
3. **Concatenation**: FFmpeg concat demuxer stitches clips together
4. **Cleanup**: Temporary files removed, output saved to `clips/edited/`

### Progress Tracking
- Uses existing `exportProgress` state for consistency
- Real-time progress updates via Tauri events
- Progress bar shows during concatenation process

## Task-Master Updates

### Completed Tasks
- âœ… **Task #1**: Implement concat button for clip tracks
  - Status: `done`
  - All subtasks completed inline during implementation

### Current Todo Status
- âœ… Concat button UI implementation
- âœ… Backend concat_clips command
- âœ… Store concatClips function
- âœ… Overlap trimming logic
- âœ… Progress feedback
- ðŸ”„ Testing functionality (pending Tauri config fix)
- ðŸ”„ Tauri v2.x config compatibility

## Bug Fix: Multi-Track Concatenation

**Issue**: Initial implementation only handled clips already in sequence on timeline, not clips on different tracks.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `concatClips` function to collect clips from all tracks
- Added logic to move all clips to track 0 (same track line)
- Implemented proper sequential positioning without gaps
- Updated overlap trimming to work with repositioned clips

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: Only sorted existing clips
const sortedClips = [...state.clips].sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start)

// After: Sort and reposition all clips to track 0
const updatedClips = sortedClips.map((clip, index) => {
  // ... overlap trimming logic ...
  return {
    ...clip,
    track: 0, // Move all clips to track 0
    start: currentPosition,
    end: currentPosition + (actualTrimEnd - clip.trimStart),
    trimEnd: actualTrimEnd
  }
})
```

## Implementation Removal

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Reason:** User decided to pursue a different approach instead of the concat button functionality.

**Changes Reverted:**
- Removed concat button from controls component
- Removed concatClips function from Zustand store
- Removed concat_clips Tauri command from Rust backend
- Updated task status to "cancelled"

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/controls.tsx` - Removed concat button UI
- `src/store/use-clip-store.ts` - Removed concatClips function
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Removed concat_clips command
- `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` - Marked task as cancelled

## Final Status

**Task Status:** Cancelled
**Implementation:** Removed
**Reason:** Alternative approach preferred by user
