# Project Log: Multi-Clip Progress & UI Improvements

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Session:** Multi-clip export progress tracking and notification UI enhancement

---

## Summary

This session focused on implementing comprehensive progress tracking for multi-clip exports and improving the export success notification UI. The main achievement was fixing the multi-clip export progress system to show accurate real-time progress for both individual clip processing and final concatenation.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Multi-Clip Export Progress System

**File:** `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`

#### Fixed Export Functions (lines 580-673)
- **Single clip export** (`export_single_clip:583`):
  - Updated to use new progress system with offset=0, range=100
  - Now properly tracks 0-100% for single clip exports

- **Multi-clip export** (`export_multi_clips:605-673`):
  - Removed duplicate/unused variables (`total_duration`, `clips_count`)
  - Implemented proportional progress tracking for each clip
  - Each clip gets progress range based on its duration relative to total
  - Progress calculation: `offset = (completed_duration / total_duration) * 90%`
  - Progress range per clip: `range = (clip_duration / total_duration) * 90%`
  - Concat phase: offset=90%, range=10%
  - Added `completed_clip_duration` tracking variable
  - Switched from sync `run()` to async `run_with_progress()` with proper parameters

**Progress Distribution:**
- Clips: 0-90% (proportionally divided by clip duration)
- Concat: 90-100% (final stitching phase)

### 2. FFmpeg Progress Engine

**File:** `src-tauri/src/utils/ffmpeg.rs`

#### Enhanced `run_with_progress` Function (lines 418-541)
- **New signature** (line 421):
  ```rust
  pub async fn run_with_progress(
      &self,
      app_handle: &tauri::AppHandle,
      duration: Option<f64>,
      progress_offset: u32,    // NEW: starting percentage
      progress_range: u32      // NEW: range this phase represents
  )
  ```

- **Progress calculation updates**:
  - Microseconds handler (lines 474-485):
    - Changed from absolute progress to phase-aware calculation
    - Formula: `offset + (phase_progress / 100 * range)`
    - Added debug logging for phase vs overall progress

  - Milliseconds handler (lines 500-507):
    - Matched calculation to microseconds handler
    - Ensures consistency across both time formats

- **Removed duplicate code** (previously lines 542-652):
  - Eliminated ~110 lines of duplicated implementation
  - Fixed compilation errors from orphaned code blocks

### 3. Export Success Notification UI

**File:** `src/components/export-button.tsx`

#### Improved Notification Styling (lines 147-154)
- **Position**: Moved from `top-4` to `top-20` (below header buttons)
- **Opacity**: Increased from `bg-green-900/20` to `bg-green-900/80` (400% increase)
- **Glass effect**: Added `backdrop-blur-md` for glassmorphism
- **Border**: Changed from `border-green-700` to `border-green-600` (brighter)
- **Shadow**: Enhanced to `shadow-2xl` for more depth
- **Text**: Added `text-white font-medium` for better readability

**Result**: Maintains beautiful glassy aesthetic while being much more readable

### 4. App Icon Format Fix

**Files:** `src-tauri/icons/icon.png`, `icon.icns`

- **Issue**: Icon was in grayscale+alpha format, Tauri requires RGBA
- **Fix**: Converted using ImageMagick to 8-bit/color RGBA
- **Command**: `magick icon.png -colorspace sRGB -type TrueColorAlpha icon.png`
- **Result**: Compilation now succeeds, app icons properly display

**New icon files generated:**
- icon-16.png, icon-32.png, icon-64.png, icon-128.png
- icon-256.png, icon-512.png, icon-1024.png
- icon.icns (macOS bundle icon)

## Task-Master Status

**All tasks completed:** 8/8 tasks done (100%)
**All subtasks completed:** 20/20 subtasks done (100%)

**Most Recent Task:**
- **Task 8**: "Enhance Export with Real FFmpeg Progress" - ✓ Done
  - All 4 subtasks completed in previous sessions
  - This session addressed follow-up issues found during review

## Technical Details

### Progress Tracking Architecture

**Single-Phase Progress (Single Clip):**
```
Clip Processing: 0% ────────────────────► 100%
```

**Multi-Phase Progress (Multiple Clips):**
```
Clip 1:  0% ──────► 30%
Clip 2: 30% ──────► 60%
Clip 3: 60% ──────► 90%
Concat: 90% ──────► 100%
```

### Code References

**Key Implementation Points:**
- Multi-clip progress setup: `lib.rs:610-628`
- Per-clip progress calculation: `lib.rs:622-627`
- Concat phase progress: `lib.rs:663-673`
- FFmpeg progress formula: `ffmpeg.rs:481`, `ffmpeg.rs:507`
- Notification styling: `export-button.tsx:148`

## Issues Resolved

1. ✅ **Multi-clip progress not showing**: Fixed by adding progress tracking to each clip
2. ✅ **Duplicate code compilation error**: Removed duplicate function implementation
3. ✅ **Incorrect progress calculation**: Fixed formula from `phase * 0.1` to `offset + (phase/100 * range)`
4. ✅ **Icon format error**: Converted grayscale to RGBA
5. ✅ **Notification hard to read**: Increased opacity and added backdrop blur
6. ✅ **Unused variable warnings**: Removed `total_duration` and `clips_count`

---

## Current Status

### Working Features
✅ Single clip export with progress (0-100%)
✅ Multi-clip export with per-clip progress (0-90%)
✅ Concatenation progress tracking (90-100%)
✅ Proportional progress based on clip duration
✅ Export success notification with glassmorphism UI
✅ Proper app icons in RGBA format

### Code Quality
✅ No compilation errors
✅ No unused variable warnings
✅ Clean, maintainable progress architecture
✅ Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

---

## Next Steps

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Test multi-clip export with various clip duration combinations
2. Consider adding progress text showing current phase (e.g., "Processing clip 2/3")
3. Monitor for any edge cases in progress calculation with very short/long clips
4. Consider adding cancel functionality during export
5. Add progress persistence for long exports (resume capability)

**UI Enhancements:**
1. Add animation to notification appearance/disappearance
2. Consider showing which clip is currently being processed
3. Add estimated time remaining based on processing speed

## Lessons Learned

1. **Multi-phase progress requires careful offset/range coordination** - Each phase must know its position in the overall timeline
2. **Glassmorphism needs balance** - 20% opacity was too transparent; 80% with backdrop blur maintains aesthetic while being readable
3. **Icon format matters** - Tauri's strict RGBA requirement caught a grayscale icon
4. **Async progress monitoring** - Spawning stderr reading in separate tokio task is essential for real-time updates
