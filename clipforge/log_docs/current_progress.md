## Recent Session (Most Recent)

### Recording Functionality Complete - January 29, 2025
**Major Achievement:** Resolved all critical recording and preview loading issues

#### Problems Solved
1. âœ… Recording stop button not working - added processing indicator
2. âœ… Duration validation errors - fixed closure issues with refs
3. âœ… Thumbnails not generating for recordings
4. âœ… Videos not auto-loading after recording
5. âœ… Plyr player not initializing without initial clips
6. âœ… Import syntax errors with UI components

#### Key Technical Wins
- **Closure Bug Fix:** Used `useRef` instead of state for duration calculation in event handlers
- **Conditional Rendering Fix:** Always render video element (hide with CSS) to ensure Plyr initializes
- **Event Timing Fix:** Attach event listeners BEFORE setting source to prevent race conditions
- **State Coordination:** Implemented multiple state flags (`isPlyrReady`, `isVideoLoaded`) for complex async ops

#### Features Added
- **Audio Device Selection:** Enumerate and select microphone for all recording modes
- **Audio Mixing:** Web Audio API integration for screen + mic recording
- **Processing Feedback:** Visual indicator during recording conversion
- **Auto-selection:** Newly recorded clips automatically load in preview

## Previous Sessions Summary

### Audio Volume Controls - January 29, 2025
**Status:** âœ… Complete

**Implemented:**
- Volume/mute persistence across clip switching
- FFmpeg audio filter support for export (`volume` and `muted` fields)
- Real-time volume changes saved to workspace
- Proper handling of stream copy vs re-encoding

**Technical Details:**
- Plyr `volumechange` event listener saves to Zustand store
- FFmpeg builder supports `.volume()` and `.mute()` methods
- Audio filters applied during export: `-af "volume=0.5"` or `-an` for muted

### Video Preview Loading - October 29, 2025
**Status:** âœ… Complete

**Fixed:**
- Black screen on initial video import (fixed with `loadedmetadata` event)
- Playhead seeking before video metadata loaded
- macOS Continuity Camera deprecation warnings

**Technical Approach:**
- Added `loadedmetadata` event listener with `{ once: true }`
- Get playhead from store (not closure) for accurate positioning
- Proper event listener cleanup on unmount

### Multi-Clip Progress & Notifications - October 29, 2025
**Status:** âœ… Complete

**Implemented:**
- Progress notifications for multi-clip exports
- Success/error toast notifications
- Per-clip progress tracking in export UI
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

## Current Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Tauri)

#### Core Components
1. **Preview (`src/components/preview.tsx`)**
   - Plyr video player with professional controls
   - State management: `isPlyrReady`, `isVideoLoaded`, `isUpdatingFromPlayer`
   - Proper event listener timing and cleanup
   - Volume/mute persistence
   - Playhead synchronization with timeline

2. **Record Button (`src/components/record-button.tsx`)**
   - Three modes: Webcam, Screen, Picture-in-Picture
   - Audio device selection and enumeration
   - Audio mixing (screen + mic) via Web Audio API
   - Processing state with visual feedback
   - Duration tracking with refs (not state)
   - Thumbnail generation before clip creation

3. **Timeline (`src/components/timeline.tsx`)**
   - Canvas-based rendering for performance
   - Multi-track support
   - Clip drag-and-drop
   - Playhead scrubbing
   - Zoom and scroll controls

4. **Media Library (`src/components/media-library.tsx`)**
   - Thumbnail grid display
   - Clip metadata (duration, resolution, codec)
   - Search and filtering
   - Drag-to-timeline support

#### State Management (Zustand)
- **Clip Store (`src/store/use-clip-store.ts`)**
  - Clips array with full metadata
  - Playhead position
  - Selected clip ID
  - Volume/mute persistence
  - Auto-selection on add
  - Workspace persistence (debounced saves)

### Backend (Rust + Tauri)

#### FFmpeg Integration
- **Builder Pattern (`src-tauri/src/utils/ffmpeg.rs`)**
  - Fluent API for complex FFmpeg commands
  - Audio filter support (volume, mute)
  - Stream copy optimization
  - Hardware acceleration when available
  - Proper error handling and logging

#### Recording System
- **WebM to MP4 conversion** via FFmpeg
- **Thumbnail generation** at specific timestamps
- **Workspace management** (save/load state)
- **File operations** (import, export, delete)

- No multi-audio track support yet

---

## Task-Master Status
- **Active Tasks:** 0
- **Completed:** Multiple bug fix sessions (not tracked in task-master)
- **Cancelled:** 1 (concat button feature - deemed unnecessary)

**Notes:** Recent work has been reactive bug fixes and improvements rather than planned feature development. Consider creating new tasks for upcoming features.

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### High Priority
None currently - core functionality is stable

### Medium Priority
1. Add recording duration warnings (>5min recordings)
2. Implement recording quality presets
3. Add live preview during recording
4. Optimize thumbnail generation (batch processing)

### Low Priority
1. Add keyboard shortcuts documentation
2. Implement undo/redo for timeline edits
3. Add clip trimming UI improvements
4. Consider transition effects between clips

- **Proper resource cleanup** (event listeners, streams, contexts)
- **Performance optimizations** (canvas rendering, debounced saves)

### Recent Improvements
- **Fixed closure bugs** by using refs appropriately
- **Eliminated race conditions** with proper event timing
- **Added state coordination** for complex async operations
- **Improved debugging** with detailed console logs

---

## Next Development Focus

### Immediate Priorities
