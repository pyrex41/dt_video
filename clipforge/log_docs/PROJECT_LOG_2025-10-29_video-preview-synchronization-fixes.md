# Project Log: 2025-10-29 - Video Preview Synchronization Fixes

## Session Summary
Enhanced video preview component with improved playhead synchronization and source loading handling to prevent stale closure values and ensure accurate playback positioning during clip changes.

## Changes Made

### Frontend - Video Preview Component
**File: `src/components/preview.tsx`**

#### Added source loading state management:
- **New ref:** `isLoadingNewSource` to track when new video sources are being loaded (line 14)
- **Purpose:** Prevents premature playhead syncing during source transitions

#### Enhanced source switching logic (lines 114-117):
```typescript
// Mark that we're loading a new source - this prevents premature syncing
isLoadingNewSource.current = true
```

#### Improved playhead synchronization (lines 178-200):
- **Fixed stale closure issue:** Recalculate `clipLocalTime` from current store state instead of using closure values
- **Added fresh state lookup:** `const currentPlayhead = useClipStore.getState().playhead`
- **Enhanced time calculation:** Fresh calculation with proper bounds checking

#### Smart metadata loading strategy (lines 202-220):
- **New condition:** Always wait for metadata when loading new sources (`isLoadingNewSource.current`)
- **One-time event listener:** Added `{ once: true }` to prevent duplicate handlers
- **Fallback logic:** Only sync immediately for existing sources with `readyState >= 2`

## Task-Master Status
- **Current Tasks:** None configured in task-master
- **Subtasks Updated:** N/A (no active tasks)
- **New Tasks Identified:** None

## Todo List Status
- **Completed:** Video preview synchronization improvements
- **In Progress:** None
- **Pending:** None
- **New Items:** None identified during implementation

## Technical Details

### Problem Solved
**Stale Closure Values in Playhead Sync:**
- Previous implementation used `clipLocalTime` from closure, which could be outdated
- Race conditions between source loading and playhead updates
- Inaccurate positioning when switching between clips

### Solution Implementation
**Fresh State Calculation:**
- Always recalculate playhead position from current store state
- Prevents stale values from causing sync errors
- Ensures accurate positioning regardless of timing

**Source Loading Awareness:**
- Track when new sources are loading to avoid premature sync attempts
- Wait for metadata before attempting synchronization
- Clean up event listeners properly with one-time handlers

### Code Quality Improvements
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging sync operations
- Proper event listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Type-safe state access with direct store queries

## Files Modified
- `src/components/preview.tsx` - Enhanced playhead synchronization logic
