# ClipForge Progress Log: Export Progress Fixes
**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Session Summary:** Implemented progress updates for multi-clip export functionality, addressing the issue where progress was only shown during the final concatenation step rather than throughout the entire export process.

## Changes Made

### Backend Implementation (src-tauri/src/lib.rs)
- **Multi-clip Export Progress Tracking** (lines 593-667):
  - Added initial progress emission at 0% before processing individual clips
  - Implemented per-clip progress updates: After each clip is processed, emit progress as `(completed_clips / total_clips) * 90%`
  - Reserved 10% of progress for the final concatenation step, which uses the existing `run_with_progress()` method
  - This ensures users see continuous progress updates during the time-consuming re-encoding phase, not just the fast stream-copy concat

### Key Implementation Details
- Progress calculation: `progress = (((i + 1) as f64 / clips.len() as f64) * 90.0) as u32`
- Uses `app_handle.emit("ffmpeg-progress", progress)` for real-time frontend updates
- Maintains existing single-clip export behavior (unchanged, continues to use `run_with_progress()` directly)
- No changes to FFmpeg command structure or file processing logic

### Frontend Integration
- **Export Button Component** (src/components/export-button.tsx):
  - Progress listener already correctly handles `ffmpeg-progress` events
  - Real-time progress bar updates via `setRealProgress(event.payload)` and `setExportProgress(event.payload)`
  - No changes needed - existing implementation works with the new backend emissions

### Build Artifacts
- Updated build files reflect the backend changes:
  - `dist/assets/index-Cx6fALRi.js` (new)
  - `dist/assets/index-DSYpqlvc.css` (new)
  - `dist/index.html` (modified)

## Task-Master Updates
- **Current Status**: Task 1 ("Implement concat button") is cancelled
- **New Task Created**: Task 2 ("Fix export progress updates for multi-clip exports") - High priority, no dependencies
  - Note: Task creation encountered API authentication issues (invalid x-api-key for Anthropic)
  - Manual task entry recommended for future sessions
- **Subtasks**: Not expanded due to API configuration issues
- **Dependencies**: No blocking dependencies identified

## Current Todo List Status
- **Completed**: Export progress implementation for multi-clip exports
- **In Progress**: Task-Master API configuration (Anthropic key validation)
- **Pending**: 
  - Resolve Task-Master API authentication issues
  - Expand Task 2 into subtasks once API is configured
  - Test multi-clip export with various clip counts and durations
  - Add unit tests for progress calculation logic

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Configure Task-Master API keys (`task-master models --setup`) to enable AI task generation
2. **Testing**: 
   - Test export with 2-5 clips of varying lengths and overlaps
   - Verify progress updates are smooth and accurate (should reach ~90% during clip processing, then 90-100% during concat)
   - Test edge cases: single clip (should behave as before), empty clips, invalid paths
3. **Enhancements**:
   - Add progress throttling in backend to prevent event spam (already implemented in FFmpeg utils)
   - Consider adding estimated time remaining based on processing speed
   - Implement cancel functionality for long-running exports
4. **Documentation**: Update README or user guide to mention improved export progress feedback
5. **Task-Master**: Once API is configured, expand Task 2 and create follow-up tasks for testing and enhancements

## Technical Notes
- **Progress Event**: `ffmpeg-progress` events now emitted throughout multi-clip export
- **File References**:
  - Core changes: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:612-614` (per-clip progress emission)
  - Initial progress: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:606` (0% emission)
  - Concat progress: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:654` (existing `run_with_progress()`)
- **Dependencies**: No external dependencies added; uses existing Tauri event emission system
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead - progress emissions are lightweight and throttled

**Session Duration**: ~45 minutes  
**Files Modified**: 8 (5 source files, 3 build artifacts)  
**Lines Changed**: ~15 (primarily progress emission additions)
