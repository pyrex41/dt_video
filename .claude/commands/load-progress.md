Load the current project progress summary into context.

Steps:

1. Read the `log_docs/current_progress.md` file to load the latest project state
2. Present the contents to provide immediate context on:
   - Recent accomplishments and features implemented
   - Current work in progress status
   - Any blockers or issues identified
   - Next steps or planned work
   - Overall project trajectory and progress patterns
   - Task-master status summary
   - Todo list current state

This command provides quick context recovery at the start of a new session or when switching between different areas of work.
